//For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.
//Of course, explain each prediction.
//Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.

let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

console.log(a+b)

    // Prediction: 55. 34 + 21 = 55
    // Actual: 55

a = 2;

console.log(a+b)

    // Prediction: 23. 21 + 2 = 23
    // Actual: 23

//Value of c is Undefined

console.log(3+4+'5');
//Prediction: 75. Because 3+4=7, but then 5 is a string and just stuck on the end.
//Actual: 75
